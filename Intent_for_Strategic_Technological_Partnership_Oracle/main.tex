% The letter's content goes here.
Shopis is a collaborative platform designed to streamline how individuals and groups manage shopping lists, purchases, and consumption planning. Our goal is to redefine the user experience through automation, real-time collaboration, and intelligent data processing. As we scale our infrastructure and optimize our backend architecture, we are actively seeking robust, secure, and enterprise-grade technological partners.

Oracle’s cloud infrastructure, distributed database solutions, and developer ecosystem present a compelling foundation for our backend and data architecture. The maturity of Oracle’s tools in terms of scalability, availability, and compliance aligns closely with our requirements, especially as we enter a critical phase of platform growth, user acquisition, and analytics integration.

Through this letter, we express our intent to explore a strategic collaboration with Oracle Corporation, particularly within the framework of the \textbf{Oracle for Startups} program. We are interested in leveraging Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Autonomous Databases, and API management services to ensure secure and scalable data handling, as well as operational resilience.

We are open to discussing potential technical integration opportunities, access to cloud credits or infrastructure support, and the possibility of joint visibility initiatives. While Shopis is committed to maintaining its operational and technological independence, we strongly believe that a partnership with Oracle could significantly accelerate our roadmap and reinforce our reliability commitments toward users.

We would welcome the opportunity to engage in preliminary discussions with your team to evaluate mutual benefits and define the possible scope of collaboration. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us for further information or to schedule a call at your earliest convenience.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
